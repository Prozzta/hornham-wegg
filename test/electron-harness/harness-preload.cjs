/**
 * The bridge a scenario gets. Deliberately small: report a result, resize the real
 * window, and ask main for the accessibility tree.
 *
 * A harness preload that exposed `require` or the whole `ipcRenderer` would let a
 * scenario reach around the renderer it is supposed to be measuring, and the first
 * convenient shortcut through it would end up being the thing under test.
 *
 * `resize` and `axTree` are here because neither is observable from inside the page:
 * a real responsive reading needs the real window to change size, not a div, and the
 * accessibility TREE is what the platform exposes to a screen reader rather than
 * what the DOM says - they differ, and #14 asks about the former.
