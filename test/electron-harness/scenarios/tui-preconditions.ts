/**
 * SCENARIO — the two preconditions that make a TUI measurement mean anything.
 *
 * BOTH WERE PAID FOR BY A VOID RUN. Andy's whole clear/erase matrix was discarded
 * because every row measured a first-run dialog instead of an input box, and because
 * a "reaction" to Ctrl-U turned out to be the same repaint frame a harmless arrow key
 * produces. Neither failure announces itself: both produce a PASSING row. So they
 * belong in the instrument, where they cost one run to find and nothing after.
 *
 *   1. THE SCREEN MUST BE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED AS A COMPOSER, OR THE MEASUREMENT
 *      IS REFUSED. See `isMeasurableComposer` for why this is not a list of dialogs.
 *   2. A FALSIFIER WITH NO CONTROL PASSES ON EVERYTHING. Any claim that a key did
 *      something must be paired with a key that should do nothing; if the two
 *      reactions are identical, what was seen is a repaint, not an effect.
 *
 * Every non-composer frame below is REAL BYTES, captured by Andy from the installed
 * TUIs with isolated provider homes and quoted rather than invented.

/**
 * Is the cursor sitting on something that is POSITIVELY a composer input line?
 *
 * THIS IS AN ALLOWLIST OF ONE SHAPE, NOT A BLOCKLIST OF DIALOGS, AND THE INVERSION
 * IS THE WHOLE POINT. The first version of this function enumerated the trust
 * screens it knew about and measured anything else. Andy's capture showed there are
 * at least four non-composer states rather than one, and which you land on depends
 * on whether the CWD or the CONFIG is fresh - but the count is not the argument.
 * The argument is that A DETECTOR THAT ENUMERATES WHAT TO REFUSE FAILS OPEN ON
 * EVERYTHING IT HAS NOT MET, so the list is always one screen behind the installer.
 *
 * WHAT THAT COSTS IS NOT A VOID ROW. Andy's driver met the Antigravity consent
 * screen, where Enter accepts a Terms of Service and a data-collection agreement on
 * the human's behalf. A blocklist has no entry for a screen nobody has seen, so it
 * would have measured it - and a measurement here means pressing keys.
 *
 * So: refuse by default, and admit only what is recognised. The same asymmetry
 * `promptLineHasText` already uses, where "don't know" keeps the block rather than
 * clearing it - a wrong refusal costs a re-run, a wrong admission presses Enter on
 * a contract.
