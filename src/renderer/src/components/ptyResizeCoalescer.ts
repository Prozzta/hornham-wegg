/**
 * Settle a burst of terminal grid changes into AT MOST ONE pty resize.
 *
 * LAG-150: a pty resize is not free on the other end. Codex (0.154) answers ANY change of
 * rows or cols by replaying its whole transcript — measured ~90 KB for ~120 lines of
 * history and ~280 KB for ~360, linear, never clearing scrollback — and every byte of it
 * goes back through main, IPC and xterm. The terminal's host changes height whenever the
 * composer under it changes height (a message queued to a busy agent shows the pending
 * list; delivering it hides the list again), and the ResizeObserver fitted and resized
 * the pty on every one of those, as well as on every tick of a window/splitter drag.
 *
 * `request(from, to)` is called after each local xterm fit that changed the grid. The pty
 * is told only once the grid has been quiet for `settleMs`, and only if the settled grid
 * differs from the grid the burst STARTED from — so a transient 19 -> 14 -> 19 rows costs
 * the agent nothing, and a 40-tick drag costs one replay instead of forty.
 *
 * Pure, with its timers injected, so the rule is tested under node rather than described
 * (the poolTimer.ts pattern).
