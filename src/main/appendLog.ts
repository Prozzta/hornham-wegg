/**
 * LOG-STALL-AV (Jim, MAIL-AV-152; 1.1.53): the hive's append-only files (log.jsonl and
 * cost-ledger.jsonl), written through a KEPT-OPEN descriptor and rotated at a size cap.
 *
 * WHY. Every row used to be an appendFileSync: open, append, close, on Electron main. The
 * antivirus rescans the file on each open/close, and the cost grows with its size. Measured
 * under the live BitDefender: ~390-460 ms and ~0.9 scanner CPU-s per row on the 70 MB log,
 * ~30 rows per delivered message = seconds of frozen main and ~25 scanner CPU-s per message.
 * A write through a descriptor that stays open costs 0.01-0.06 ms and triggers no rescan.
 *
 * SYNCHRONOUS ON PURPOSE (writeSync on the open fd, not a write stream). The cost was the
 * open/close scan, not the synchronicity, so a kept-open fd removes it while keeping every
 * property the old append had: rows land in order, a reader (logTail, a test) sees a row the
 * moment appendLog returns, and a crash or quit loses nothing (no buffer to flush).
 *
 * KEEP-OPEN is the default (Jim, LOG-STALL-AUDIT-153 B3): production and the tests run the same
 * path. A holder must CLOSE before deleting or copying the folder (HiveManager.dispose), since
 * Windows cannot remove a directory while a file in it is open. `keepOpen: false` opens, writes
 * and closes per row (the old cost, on a bounded file).
 *
 * ROTATION bounds what any remaining scan (a reopen, a tail reader, a backup tool) can cost.
 * At the cap the live file is closed and renamed to `<base>.<stamp>.jsonl`; the next row
 * reopens a fresh live file. Rotated files are immutable. `keep` bounds how many are kept
 * (the oldest are deleted); the cost ledger keeps all (the lifetime cost is folded from it).
 * A pre-existing file already over the cap when first opened, before any rotation ever ran
 * (today's 74 MB log), is rotated to `<base>.legacy-<stamp>.jsonl`, which is NEVER deleted:
 * that history is the Human's. (Once rotated files exist, an oversize live file is one whose
 * rename was busy; it rotates normally and is pruned like any other.)
 *
 * At a rotation the live file is recreated at once (a reader never finds it missing), and the
 * old descriptor is closed ASYNCHRONOUSLY: the scan the antivirus runs at that close (~300 ms
 * at 8 MB) happens off the main thread. The rename works with the old descriptor still open
 * (Node opens with share-delete on Windows).
