/**
 * Lifetime cost, recovered from `cost-ledger.jsonl`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ───────────────
 * `AgentUsageSample.usd` is a CUMULATIVE-SINCE-PROCESS-START counter, not a
 * lifetime one. `TelemetryCollector` accumulates into in-memory maps
 * (`sessions` / `agentSessions`), so an app restart rebuilds them empty and the
 * counter restarts at ~0 under the SAME `session_id` (the agent resumes; only
 * our accumulator forgot). Every consumer that reads the LAST value therefore
 * understates spend for any agent that has been through a restart.
 *
 * Measured on the live ledger 2026-08-21: 38 such resets, last-value total
 * $987.04 against a true $2,406.64, i.e. 59% of spend invisible.
 *
 * THE RECOVERY
 * ────────────
 * The ledger keeps every line, so the pre-reset peaks are still on disk. Within
 * one (agent, session) the counter only ever climbs, so a DECREASE is the reset
 * signature and nothing else. Lifetime is then:
 *
 *     sum(peak of each closed segment) + peak of the open segment
 *
 * Any decrease counts, with only a float-noise epsilon. A dollar threshold was
 * considered and rejected: two genuine restarts in the live ledger drop from
 * $0.92 and $0.73 straight to $0.00, and a $1 threshold silently misses both.
 * A cumulative counter has no legitimate reason to go down, so the magic number
 * bought nothing and cost coverage.
 *
 * COST / SHAPE
 * ────────────
 * The ledger is append-only and already 32MB (162k lines, 126 distinct
 * agent+session keys). A full fold is ~800ms, which must NOT land on the
 * Electron main thread, so folding is async and INCREMENTAL: each pass reads
 * only the bytes appended since the last one and keeps the running segment
 * state. Steady-state cost per pass is a few hundred bytes.
 *
 * Read-only: this module never writes to the ledger.
